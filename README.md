This folder contains the codes for Digital Africa Assignment.
## Question 1 :
Create a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number.Instructions: Create a new Python file named factorial.py in your local directory. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion or iteration. After writing the code, initialize a Git repository in the directory, add the file, commit the changes, and push it to a new repository on GitHub.

## Question 2:

Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.Instructions: Create a new Python file named remove_duplicates.py. Write the program to take a list as input and remove duplicate elements, preserving the original order. After writing the code, initialize a Git repository in the directory, add the file, commit the changes, and push it to a new repository on GitHub.

## Question 3:

Write a Python program to find the intersection of two sets.Instructions: Create a new Python file named set_intersection.py. Write the program to take two sets as input and find their intersection. After writing the code, initialize a Git repository in the directory, add the file, commit the changes, and push it to a new repository on GitHub.

## Question 4:

Create a Python function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.Instructions: Create a new Python file named anagram_check.py. Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., contain the same characters but in a different order). After writing the code, initialize a Git repository in the directory, add the file, commit the changes, and push it to a new repository on GitHub.

## Question 5:

Create a Python function that finds the maximum and minimum elements in a list.Instructions: Create a new Python file named max_min.py. Write a function to find the maximum and minimum elements in a given list. After writing the code, initialize a Git repository in the directory, add the file, commit the changes, and push it to a new repository on GitHub.

## Question 6:

Create a new branch named "sort-strings-by-length". Write a Python program to sort a list of strings based on the length of each string. Instructions: Create a new Python file named sort_strings_by_length.py. Write the program to take a list of strings as input and sort it based on the length of each string, from shortest to longest. After writing the code, initialize a Git repository in the directory, add the file, commit the changes, and push it to a new repository on GitHub. Finally, merge the branch into the main branch.
